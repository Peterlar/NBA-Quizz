# **Deployment**

The site was deployed via Heroku.
This project was developed utilising the Code Institute Template. 

Before deploying to Heroku pip3 freeze > requirements.txt was used to add pyfiglet for deployment.

* Results will show the guesses from the player and the correct answers. Below an procentage will be visible displaying the score. Player will also be able to play again by answering "YES" or "No" and then hit enter. If player enters "NO" and message will occur or the game restarts from the beginning.

**Future Features:**
* Weekly new questions
* Highscore List
* NBA Highlights of the week.

# **Libraries & Technology Used**

* Pyfiglet for adding ascii art.


# **Testing**

I have manually tested this project by doing:

* Passed the code through a PEP8 linter and confirmed there are no problems.
* Tested in my lokal terminal and the Code Institute Heroku Terminal.
* Tested the game after each question was added to check it worked.

**Bugs**

* During the project i was getting type of errors that was caused by not have entered enough blankspaces. It was solved during the PEP8 linter testing.
